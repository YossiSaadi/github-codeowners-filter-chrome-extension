# Privacy Policy for GitHub Code Owners Filter

Last updated: 22/11/2024

## Overview

GitHub Code Owners Filter is a browser extension that enhances the GitHub pull request interface by adding file filtering capabilities based on code ownership information. This extension is committed to protecting user privacy and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.

## Data Collection

This extension:

- Does not collect any user data
- Does not store any information locally or remotely
- Does not make any external network requests
- Does not use cookies or any tracking mechanisms
- Only reads code ownership information that is already visible on GitHub pull request pages

## Data Usage

The extension only processes code ownership information that is already displayed on GitHub pull request pages to provide filtering functionality. This processing:

- Occurs entirely within your browser
- Is temporary (only while viewing the page)
- Is never transmitted anywhere
- Is never stored

## Permissions

This extension requires minimal permissions:

- `activeTab`: Required to read the current GitHub page content for filtering
- `https://github.com/*`: Required to run on GitHub pull request pages

These permissions are used solely to provide the core functionality of filtering files by code ownership.

## Changes to This Policy

Will be commited to this file, and versioned on this GitHub repo.
